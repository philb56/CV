## Phil Bugden

I am an experienced software developer having worked for a long long time as an Oracle dev in large organisations across many different industry sectors. I have a particular interest in Agile having acted as Scrum Master in my last two jobs. Following through on this interest I am cross-training as a web developer, learning languages such as Ruby and Javascript and honing development techniqus such as OO and TDD which more readily lend themselves to Agile development. 

I am a great believer in the power of the team and, as a consequence, try very hard to make the team work together. I am a good observer of the team and tend to notice when people are uncomfortable and am ready to offer support, whether helping with a technical issue or trying to resolve some sort of personal issue or building intra or inter team bridges.

Over the many years of my career I have come to realise that we can never be experts as there is always something new to learn. Learning and changing to cope with new situations is what being a developer is all about - hence the cross-training at Makers Academy.

#### Scrum Master

In 2007 Man Group made a strategic decision to move to Agile development. As a result I became a Certified Scrum Master by attending a Scrum Alliance course presented by Geoff Watts and an Agile Practices course which looked at OO, CI and TDD. I helped Man's GRI project to adapt to the new mode of working including acting as Scrum Master. As this project was already established with a legacy of Oracle PL/SQL and C# code their were many challenges for example trying to get TDD working in an established and largely procedural codebase. At EON I continued as a part-time Scrum Master on the Smart PAYG project.  


#### Oracle Developer

I have worked as an Oracle developer on enterprise level projects for many different companies. During this time I have taken on a wide range of different roles all centered around my knowledge of Oracle 
- Oracle 11g
- PL/SQL 
- ETL using many different techniques - request response, publish/subsribe, DB links
- Relational design
- Performance enhancements
- Development techniques - TDD, Continuous Integration, Pair programming
- Some C# development
